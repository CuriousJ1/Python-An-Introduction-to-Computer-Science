    "One proven technique for tackling complex problems i called top-down design. The absic idea is to start with the general problem and try to express a solution in terms fo smaller problems. Then each of the smaller problems is attacked in turn using the same techniquie. Eventually the problems get so small that they are trivial to solve. Then you just put all the pieces back together and, voila, you've got a program.\n",
