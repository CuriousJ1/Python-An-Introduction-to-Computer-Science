    "True/ False\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Programmers rarely define their own functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers use functions to reduce code duplication and to help structure or modularise programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A function may only be called at one place in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "False.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can be called multiple time from many places in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Information can be passed into a function through parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "True.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters allows functions to have changeable parts. The parameters appearing in the function definition are called formal parameters, and the expressions appearing in a function call are known as actual parameters.\n",

    "4. Every Python function returns some value.\n",
    "\n",
    "False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can communicate information back to the caller through return values. In Python, funcrtions may return multiple values. Value - returning functions should generally be called from inside an expressions. Functions that don't explicitly return a value return the special object none.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In Python, some parameters are passed by reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "False.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "False.\n",

    "9. Variables defined in a function are local to that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "True.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. It's a bad idea to define new function if it makes a program longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "True. WRONG\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your own words, describe the two motivations for defining functions in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The two motivations is that it keeps code very clean and readable, whilst reducing duplications and potentially making the code more effecient.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The second motivation of the function is, they improve code reusability. Coders need not write same logic multiple times in multiple places.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. We have been thinking about computer programs as sequences of instructions where the computer methodically executes one instruction and then moves on to the next one. Do programs that contain functions fit this model? Explain your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In a sense yes. A function is kind of like a subprogram. Programmers use function to reduce code duplication and to help structure or modularize programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Once a function is defined, it may be called from many different places in a program. Paramters allows function to have changeable parts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The parameters appearing in the function defeiniton are called formal paramters, and the expressions appearing in a function call are known as actual parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Parameters are an important concept in defining functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. What is the purpose of parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "        Parameters are special variables in a function that are initialized at the time of a call with information passed from a caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. What is the difference between a formal parameter and an actual parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Parameters that appear in the function definiition are formal parameters.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        However expressions appearing in a function call are known as actual parameters.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "    c. In what ways are parameters similar to and different from ordinary variables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Functions can be thought of as miniature (sub)programs inside other programs. Like any other program, we can think of function as having input and output to communicate with the main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. How does a program provide \"input\" to one of its functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "        A function is created within a function providing a name and actual parameter that requieres input.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "    b. How does a function provide \"output\" to the program?\n",
    "    \n",
    "        When a function is executed, with either a print statement ro return statement, an output is provided.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Consider this very simple function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def cube(x)\n",
    "        answer = x * x * x\n",
    "        return answer\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. What does this function do?\n",
    "    \n",
    "        This function cube roots x\n",
    "        \n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Show how a program could use this function to print the value of y^3, assuming y is a variable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        X** 3\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Here is a fragment of a program that uses this function:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        answer = 4\n",
    "        result = cube(3)\n",
    "        print (answer, result)\n",
    "\n",
    "        The output from this fragment is 4 27. Explain why the output is not 27 27, even though cube seems to change the value of answer to 27.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        As answer is already defined as 4 in the program and result gives the cube root"
