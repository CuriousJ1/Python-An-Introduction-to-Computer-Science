# Python-An-Introduction-to-Computer-Science

## Summary
This third edition of John Zelle's Python Programming continues the tradition of updating the text to reflect new technologies while maintaining a time-tested approach to teaching introductory computer science. An important change to this edition is the removal of most uses of eval and the addition of a discussion of its dangers. In our increasingly connected world, it's never too early to begin considering computer security issues. This edition also uses several new graphics examples, developed throughout chapters 4-12

## Purpose
This was the first and best textbook I used to understand Computer Science through the lense of Python.
